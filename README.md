# Ping Pong Tracker
A p5.js app to keep track of score in Ping Pong.

[Launch](https://seeker14491.github.io/ping-pong/)

On iOS, it's recommended to add the page to the home screen. Launching from the home screen allows removing browser elements and thus makes the app function more like a native app.
